    <p>KD: "I'm going to share a bit about my journey with PMDD: Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder. Maybe 7 years ago I started to experience, around the 10 days before my period, which I now know is called the luteal phase. I don't know why I learnt... I learnt so much about the menstrual cycle at the age of 27. It wasn't really taught at school, or you know, I really had to do all my own research on what was going on in my own body. So yeah, around the 10 day mark before I get my period, I'd have a massive shift in moods, which, it often started with sore nipples and a migraine. And then after that it would be mood and I would be so sad and depressed. [laughs] Like this horrible dread of everything and I was like 'What is this?' and it kept happening. In those 10 days, my boobs would become...it'd start with the nipples and it radiate outwards and my boobs would just become these, like, hard rocks that hurt to carry around even like, taking steps around the house. But too sore to put in a sports bra, I was like 'What is this?' Started getting more migraines the closer I got to my period - really intense migraines. And then when I got my period, everything would disappear. It would be like - yeah I'd get through day 1 and 2 of the horrible pain that my periods bring. Then I'd experience this elation and be like 'What was that? Life is amazing!' blah blah blah and I'd get my energy back. I went to see a GP about this, cos it just kept happening and actually getting worse. And the GP was like 'I don't know' [laughs] 'Maybe you've got Bipolar Disorder?'. And I went - not for that - just for better mental health management, I started seeing a psych. I brought it up with my psych and she said 'Hmm, maybe you should see a sexologist about this?'. I consulted one who does have PMDD - it was just by chance - and I'm not even sure if the sexologist is the person to go to, but she shared with me her experience and she had a diagnosis and I was like, ok cool, I've definitely got it then. I actually had more symptoms than she did. I get the physical and emotional symptoms. So then I went back to the GP to get a referral to an endocrinologist to get a PMDD diagnosis.  And I was put on a waitlist and it was going to cost me like $700 or something for the entire thing and I was a student at the time, and I was like, nah. [laughs] Then I, I mean, I still don't have an actual diagnoses. I don't even need one. Because I know I have it and it's not like it's recognises as something, as anything. It is debilitating for about 30% of my life. 30% of my life while I'm in this phase of the life cycle of my period. You know i'm 32, I guess I won't hit menopause for about 10 more years, maybe longer. It's yeah, it's just, something I have to deal with, um, without any support, without any healthcare really. And it's bloody impossible. [laughs] It feels sometimes impossible - but I'm doing the best I can. So yeah, every GP that I've brought this up with, every single one,  and I think it's about - cos I move around a lot - it'd be about 10 GPs or more, every single one of them has said 'What's PMDD?' and I think that says everything. And I know so many people who experience PMDD. People who have PMDD without a diagnoses and we don't need one, like, we know we have it. So yeah, I feel, um, like, healthcare has let me down. Yeah."</p>
