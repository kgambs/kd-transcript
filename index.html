                        “If you can stay at home, you must stay at home” – Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, March 25th,
                        2020
                        Stay at Home explores how the pandemic affects those who experience domestic violence, when
                        lockdown doesn’t restrict your independence but your safety.
                        No need to be self-conscious; you’re at home.

                    Kasey is a multi-disciplinary artist and co-founder of Melbourne production company, The Honeytrap.
                    A graduate of the Victorian College of the Arts (Music Theatre), Kasey went on to train in Meisner
                    Technique at Ward Studio in both New York and Melbourne. Credits include: Miss Fisher’s Murder
                    Mysteries (Every Cloud Productions), Neighbours (Fremantle Media), The Ring Cycle and The Barber of
                    Seville (Opera Australia). Kasey co-devised and performed in Clare McCracken’s immersive
                    installation Section 32 (Immerse Festival) as well as immersive theatrical productions Beware the
                    Youth and Are You There, Louise Lovely? (Little Sister Projects). She is also creator of web series
                    Women’s Empower Hour (The Honeytrap) and played Lizzie in the hybrid-documentary We’re All In This
                    Together (dir. Logan Mucha) which screened as part of the Melbourne Queer Film Festival. Kasey wrote
                    and directed The Maze winning the Melbourne Fringe NSW Tour Ready Award(Sydney Fringe), The
                    Summerhall Award (Summerhall, Edinburgh), and the John Chataway Innovation Award (Adelaide Fringe).
                    In 2020, Kasey completed her residency as an Aphid’s Supermassive Studio Artist and was a recipient
                    of the Ian Potter Cultural Trust. She also wrote and produced Stay at Home as a part of Melbourne
                    Fringe’s ShowSupport. More recently, Kasey completed a secondment with UK performance makers Coney
                    on digital work, How We Save The World and produced her first game, Lockdown 6.0. Kasey is
                    interested in creating feminist site-specific works that explore the link between place and
                    oppressed and marginalised voices.
